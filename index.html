                The Proof
                Independent Hackney-based bakery The Proof delivers fresh puddings and cakes to Londoners’ doorsteps. Founded by former
                music journalist and self-taught baker, Francesca Strange, the young bakery has recently added profiteroles) to its menu
                of delicious desserts. The assemble-at-home ‘Proofiteroles’ arrive with an array of toppings and require just enough
                assembly to convince your dinner guests that you baked them from scratch. Elsewhere, The Proof Box makes an ideal gift
                or dinner party accessory. The eco-friendly package contains a selection of four pairs of miniature desserts (eight
                pieces in total), which rotate seasonally, ensuring there is something for everyone.

            <p>April’s Baker
            April’s Baker is a cake company set up by Roxy Mankoo, who trained at Le Cordon Bleu, and has worked at notable bakeries
            in London and New York – including Lily Vanilli and Ron Ben-Israel Cakes. Launched in November 2019, April’s Baker has
            since dedicated itself to creating cakes that showcase a glimmer of fantasy and capture vintage elegance. Each bake is
            inspired by the dreamy landscapes of Wes Anderson, pastel palettes used by Miu Miu, and a nod to the artistic
            decorations of artist Scott Hove.

            <p>Clementine's Cakes
            Celebrate a loved one, a special occasion or just treat yourself by ordering one of Clementine’s Cakes. Born out of
            lockdown and the desire to show friends and family what they really mean to us, Clementine’s Cakes combines art and
            baking to create memorable celebration cakes. Each bake is entirely different in its design and is baked in Clementine’s
            kitchen. We love the look of one of her recent bakes, which was covered in dried fruit and edible flowers.</p>
