                <p class="site-description">We’ve been baking glorious cakes for almost 70 years now, and the range of Rei cakes we offer today includes both French classics and more contemporary favourites, with plenty of French chic. All are tried, tested and loved by our customers, and available for delivery in London.  


                    Life is just better with cake, and no special or celebratory occasion – birthday, anniversary, retirement, reunion – is complete without a showstopping confection to share. Every Rei cake is a little celebration and designed to add joy to your happy day. Our collection includes cakes that also make for delectable desserts, such as our elegant, creamy Strawberry Summer Cheesecake and Apricot Cheesecake, and our authentic French Strawberry or Raspberry Charlottes, filled with the lightest, smoothest Bavarian cream and generously topped with fresh berries.  
                    
                    
                    Fruity or chocolaty, creamy or nutty, there’s something for everyone, and any occasion, with our cake delivery in London. </p>
