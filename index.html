            Cupcakes have been made since the early 1800s. These delicious treats are individual cakes typically decorated with icing and frosting. They are fairly easy to make and appeal to people of all ages looking for a tasty treat in a small size. Cupcakes are served at parties, birthdays, other events and in the home as a sweet snack. B
            uns, bagels, brownies and brioche – London’s bakery scene has it all.
            
            <p>But if there is one baked good that really takes the biscuit when it comes to irresistible allure, its the disarmingly charming and always perfectly pretty cupcake.
            </p>
            <p>
            A veritable peacock of the baking world, the magnetism of a precisely frosted cake topped with a few of your favourite things can make even the most serious food fan go all gooey inside.
            
            From the frosting-laden to the curiously flavoured via Meghan Markle’s favourite bakery, these are the cupcakes you need to sink your sweet teeth into in London.
