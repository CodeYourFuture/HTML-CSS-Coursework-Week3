                    Whether you want a simple, luxury, novelty or fanciful Wedding Cake we will work with you every step of the way to create the perfect centrepiece for your special day.
                    Weddings are very special and personal occasions, many people have very specific ideas about what they want but arranging and organising everything can be difficult and stressful.
                    We have been making Wedding Cakes for years now and we always try to use our knowledge and experience to make planning and ordering your cake an exciting and stress free experience. Once you have ordered your cake from us we will deliver and set up your cake on the day to ensure everything is perfect for when you and your guests arrive at your chosen venue.
