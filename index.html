                    We hand-make our Sponge Cakes in our bakery in Holt, Norfolk and offer cake delivery anywhere in the UK, 
                    offering next day delivery as standard. We make our cakes with a lot of care and love using quality and local 
                    ingredients and we are always adding new flavours and ranges. We use robust packaging to ensure that your Sponges
                     arrive to you safely and undamaged so you don't have to worry about ordering cake online. As well as having over 14 
                     flavours of standard cakes we also make delicious gluten free cakes and scrummy vegan cakes. We are very proud of these 
                     ranges and don't think you will be able to tell the difference between these and our standard sponge cakes. Make sure you 
                     can always get the perfect birthday cake whether its a chocolate birthday cake, gluten free birthday cake or vegan birthday 
                     cake - we've got you covered!

                    pre-designed cake toppers to really make someoneâ€™s day. As well as that you can add gift cards suitable for any occasion, 
                    one of our tipples such as prosecco or a G&T, or a hot drink or soft drink, candles or balloons! Can't find the flavour you want?
