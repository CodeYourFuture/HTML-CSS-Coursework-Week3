# Notes

- What did you find easy?
1.I found it easy to create the HTML structure.
2.I am pretty familiar with flexbox right now and I love how easy the displaying process has become. I used to struggle with this in the last weeks so this is a big step forward for me. 

- What did you find hard?
Sometimes I find it quite hard to do the debugging. 

- What do you still not understand?
I am still not very familiar with the Inspect tool. I struggled a bit using it.

- Any other notes?
I really enjoyed working on this project and with each small progress I made, I was feeling more engaged and eager to add more sections in order to improve the website.
