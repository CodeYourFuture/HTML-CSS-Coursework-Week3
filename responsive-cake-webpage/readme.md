3) Once you've started coding (folllowing the instructions below), remember to commit and push your code frequently.
4) When you're ready to share something (even if it's unfinished!), open a Pull Request so a teacher can review your work.


## Exercise

### Start with your mobile design
- Draw a wireframe of how the website will look like on mobile
- Write the HTML following this mobile design
- Then write your CSS for everything to look great on mobile

### Then adapt the page to look good on desktop
- Now add media queries to your CSS, and change the layout and sizing of elements so they make better use of a wider screen
