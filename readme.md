## Challenge Overview

Made to create a **responsive webpage** showcasing your cake business, based on two provided wireframes.

## Wireframes

Build the mobile wireframe first, then adapt it for larger screens.

## Approach

Make a template for the three screen scenarios

### Define your own style

- Choose 1-2 fonts to use (lots of [free fonts here](https://fonts.google.com/))
- Choose 2-3 colours that you think go together well, and try to limit yourself to those in your CSS ([look here](https://coolors.co/palettes/trending) for inspiration)
- Select some nice cake pictures to replace the placeholders in the wireframes (good [photo source here](https://unsplash.com/images/food/cake)).

### mobile first

- Page designed with a mobile first design approach
- Then write your CSS for everything to look great on mobile

### larger screens

- Following the mobile first approach the page was adjusted with media queries larger screen layouts and sizing of elements so they make better use of a wider screen

### breakpoints

> - breakpoint 1 --> 700px
> - breakpoint 2 --> 701px

Then our CSS code will be split into **3**:

> 1. **"default"**: default styles, should implement the mobile design (no media query used for these). These styles will apply to all screen sizes by default.
> 2. **"medium and large"**: The second media query `@media (min-width: 701px) with no upper limit
